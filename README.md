## 📌 Overview

**QuoteBuilder** was created to streamline the costing and sales proposal process for a custom engineering manufacturing company where **no two products were ever the same**.

Previously, team members relied on partially manual Excel workbooks and individually looked up raw material prices several times a week. This project introduced:

- 📂 A **centralized Access database** for shared pricing data  
- 🧰 A **user-friendly Excel GUI** for navigating, editing, and generating proposals  
- 🔄 Tools for **auto-updating workbook code** and **duplicating legacy templates**  
- 🧾 Automatic **Bill of Materials (BOM)** generation, ready for client presentation  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**
- **Microsoft Excel** — userForms for GUI, worksheet automation
- **Microsoft Access** — shared database for material prices and metadata
- **SQL Queries in VBA** — to interact with the Access database

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

- ❌ Manual entry of raw material prices across multiple files  
- ❌ Repetitive formatting and proposal generation  
- ❌ Lack of version control for VBA procedures in team workbooks  
- ❌ Inconsistent templates and quote calculation workflows  

✅ **QuoteBuilder** centralized data, standardized processes, and saved hours per week for each team member.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔍 **Centralized Access Database**: Update once, available to all users
- 🖥️ **Excel GUI Interface**: Built with userForms for easy interaction
- 📤 **Code Auto-Updater**: Keeps team macros in sync
- 📑 **Automated BOM Generator**: Sales-ready, formatted output
- 📄 **Legacy File Copier**: Supports various workbook templates
- 🧩 **Modular VBA Code**: SQL queries integrated into Excel logic

## 🚀 Getting Started

> ⚠️ This project was built on top of an existing Excel workbook. The base design was not originally mine and was highly customized to the company’s needs.

### Requirements:
- Microsoft Excel (with macros enabled)
- Microsoft Access
- Windows environment (for file path compatibility)

### To Run:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the included workbook
3. Ensure the Access `.accdb` database is in the same folder (or update the connection path in code)
4. Enable macros and click the launch button on the GUI

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

While I no longer work for the company, this type of solution could easily be adapted for similar industries. Given the opportunity, I'd improve:

- 🧪 Unit testing and better error handling
- 🧼 Code refactoring for readability
- 🎨 GUI design polish
